# MERNBookSearchEngine

This week's challenge, youâ€™ll take a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. This final challenge required the use of being able to take a fully functional Google Books API search engine which is implemented with RESTful API which is then used to be a GraphQL API having been built with an Apollo Server. This challenge proved to be quite time consuming and also proved to be very challenging in regards to being able to implement various components needed in order to complete the challenge. Upon learning and researching the working ground of being able to use GraphQL API and the Apollo Server demonstrates a variety of working qualifications that utilize the MERN stack. The MERN application is being created in order for the user to search up a book they want to read through the Google Book Search. They are then able to proceed by searching the book of their choosing while also being able to save it which is then logged in by your profile. The user can view all the books they have searched and be able to go back to see the ones they have saved as well for further collection of books the user is interested in. This challenge proved to be quite fascinating  as it embodied a lot of research. Lots of topics and information that was discovered all became new ground and really provided further gain of knowledge that was not accessed before most notably the topic of MERN, RESTful API, GraphQL, etc and how each component plays a part in the utilization of having a fully functional MERN book search engine.
